/**
 * 138. Squares Squared
 * 
 * Create a function of two integer arguments: the start and end, respectively.
 * You must create a list of strings which renders a 45Â° rotated square of integers which are successive squares from
 * the start point up to and including the end point.
 * If a number comprises multiple digits, wrap them around the shape individually.
 * If there are not enough digits to complete the shape, fill in the rest with asterisk characters.
 * The direction of the drawing should be clockwise, starting from the center of the shape and working outwards,
 * with the initial direction being down and to the right.
